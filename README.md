# 2024-organismal-selection

[![run with conda](http://img.shields.io/badge/run%20with-conda-3EB049?labelColor=000000&logo=anaconda)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)

Note: Analysis repo names should be prefixed with the year (e.g., `2024-noveltree-analysis`). This prefix can be changed at time of publication if appropriate.

## Purpose

This repository contains code for performing analyses related to the pub "Leveraging evolution to identify novel organismal models of human biology". Code for proteome curation, phylogenomic inference, and molecular conservation calculations can be found HERE [replace with link].

## Installation and Setup

This repository uses conda to manage software environments and installations. You can find operating system-specific instructions for installing miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installing conda and [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), run the following command to create the pipeline run environment.

```{bash}
TODO: Replace <NAME> with the name of your environment
mamba env create -n <NAME> --file envs/dev.yml
conda activate <NAME>
```

<details><summary>Developer Notes (click to expand/collapse)</summary>

As your project develops, the number of dependencies in your environment may increase. Whenever you install new dependencies (e.g., using `mamba install`), you should update the environment file using the following command.

```{bash}
conda env export --from-history --no-builds > envs/dev.yml
```

`--from-history` only exports packages that were explicitly added by you (e.g., the packages you installed with `mamba`) and `--no-builds` removes build specification from the exported packages to increase portability between different platforms.

## Data

TODO: Add details about the description of input / output data and links to Zenodo depositions, if applicable.

## Overview

### Description of the folder structure

### Methods

TODO: Include a brief, step-wise overview of analyses performed.

> Example:
>
> 1. Download scripts using `download.sh`.
> 2. Preprocess using `./preprocessing.sh -a data/`
> 3. Run analysis script using `analysis.Rscript`
> 4. Generate figures using `pub/make_figures.R`.

### Compute Specifications

TODO: Describe what compute resources were used to develop and run the analysis. For example, you could list the operating system, number of cores, RAM, and storage space. You should log any major changes to the compute specifications here as they happen.

## For Developers

This section contains information for developers who are working off of this template. Please adjust or edit this section as appropriate when you're ready to share your repo.

### GitHub templates
This template uses GitHub templates to provide checklists when making new pull requests. These templates are stored in the [.github/](./.github/) directory.

### `.gitignore`
This template uses a `.gitignore` file to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository.

### Linting
This template automates linting using GitHub Actions and the [`lintr` linter](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/vignettes/lintr.html). When you push changes to your repository, GitHub will automatically run the linter and report any errors, blocking merges until they are resolved.
